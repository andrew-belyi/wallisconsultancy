              <div class="post-content">
                <p>Mediation is a voluntary process conducted confidentially in
                  which I as a trained neutral person, known as a mediator, assists
                  parties in working towards a negotiated agreement of a dispute
                  or difference, with the parties themselves remaining in control
                  of the decision to settle and the terms of any resolution.</p>
                  <p>This service is available for workplace, neighbourhood or family disputes for West Hertfordshire 				Mediation Needs.</p>
                  <p>Family mediation helps you and your ex to work out an agreement about issues such as:</p>
                <ul class="p-list">
                  <li>Arrangements for children after you break up</li>
                  <li>Child maintenance payments</li>
                  <li>Finances</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It can also be used to help with the other issues you might face,
                  for example, your children keeping in touch with their grandparents,
                  step families, or in-laws.</p>
