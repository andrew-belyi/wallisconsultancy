                  The service is available for workplace mediation, 
                  neighbourhood mediation and family mediation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mediation is a voluntary process conducted confidentially 
                  in which I as a trained neutral person, known as a 
                  mediator, assists parties in working towards a 
                  negotiated agreement of a dispute or difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The service is accessible for mediation in Hemel 
                  Hempstead, mediation in Berkhamsted and for mediation 
                  in Tring. The service is therefore able to be used for 
                  these areas of mediation in the whole of the Borough 
                  of Dacorum, Hertfordshire.
                </p>

                  Workplace Mediation can help settle conflict between staff 
                  and between staff and management or within management.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Neighbourhood Mediation is helpful when neighbours or groups 
                  within a community are not able agree on an issue. 
                  Its use can stop matters getting out of control. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Family mediation can help you and your ex to work out an 
                  agreement about issues such as arrangements for 
                  children after you break up, child maintenance 
                  payments or a financial settlement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Mediation can also be useful to help with other issues you 
                  might face, such as your children keeping in touch with their 
                  randparents, step families, or in-laws. It can also be useful 
                  for disputes within families and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Any agreement reached through mediation, whether verbal 
                  or written is not legally binding but it is more likely 
                  to succeed as it has not been imposed on the parties.
