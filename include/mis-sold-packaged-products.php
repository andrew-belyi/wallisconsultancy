                    <li>You were told you had to get a packaged account to get a loan, morgage or overdraft</li>
                    <li>You were over 65, and found out that your travel insurance did not cover over 65s</li>
                    <li>You were incorrectly told you would get unbeatable discounts on things like home insurance</li>
                    <li> You were not told you had to register for your mobile phone to be covered and only found out it wasn't covered when making a claim</li>
                    <li>You were sold a fee - paying account, or upgraded to one, without your knowledge</li>
                    <li>The sales person was pushy and made you feel that you had no other option but to get a fee paying account</li>
