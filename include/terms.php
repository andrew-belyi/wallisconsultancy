                 <p>The following terms constitute the Terms of Business (the "Terms of Business") of Michael Anthony Wallis trading as Wallis Consultancy to provide consultancy services as described below. They will apply to all transactions between both parties, unless varied in writing.</p>

                       <li>"Letter of Authority" means the letter to be signed and returned by yourself to us in order to authorise us to act as your representative in all dealings in respect of working with a product provider and confirming acceptance of these Terms of Business.</li>
                       <li>“Disclosure Statement” means the statement to be signed and returned by yourself to us confirming that you are attaching copies of all documents, including any in electronic form, that are in your possession and are relevant to the claim.</li>
                       <li>"bank" means any bank, building society or credit card company.</li>

                     </ol>
                    <li class="terms-header">Conduct</li>
                    <ol class="terms-content">
                      <li>We shall carry out your instructions in accordance with applicable professional standards and act in your best interests in pursuing any claim for compensation and obtaining for you the best result reasonably obtainable. </li>
                    </ol>
                    <li class="terms-header">Scope and basis of our work</li>
                    <ol class="terms-content">
                      <li>The consultancy service that we will offer relates to help in sorting out financial disputes with any bank, financial institution or seller of a financial product.</li>
                      <li>We may be required to hold and process information about your personal and business bank accounts effected. In consequence it will be necessary for you, and you agree, to provide us with details of your personal and financial circumstances and such other information and documents that we may specifically request and are necessary to support a claim.</li>
                      <li>We will rely on the information and documents that you provide us with as being true, correct and complete. We will not audit, test or check such information or documents except where this is inconsistent with our obligations under the law. You should let us know immediately of any changes that might affect the service and advice we provide you.</li>
                      <li>We will act on your behalf as your sole representative in respect of matters that we are instructed on the Letter of Authority and will ask any lender to check any other accounts that you may have which have not been specifically listed.</li>
                      <li>You will provide all information reasonably requested by Wallis Consultancy in order to pursue a claim. This will include evidence relating to the sale of a product such as product agreement, loan agreement or credit card statement sought under the Disclosure Statement or subsequent to this.</li>
                      <li>You will not enter into any agreements (including a pre-court agreement) without first consulting Wallis Consultancy.</li>
                      <li>We will endeavour to recover all such monies sought and undertake to forward any payment to you within seven days from the date received, subject to the agreed fees as per section 5. In consideration therefore we will:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Prepare any necessary correspondence</li>
                        <li>Review all information provided in relation to the claim</li>
                        <li>Undertake all necessary negotiation and settlement figures on your behalf</li>
                      </ul>
                    </ol>
                    <li class="terms-header">Communication</li>
                    <ol class="terms-content">
                      <li>Unless otherwise instructed, we shall communicate with you by e-mail or at your home address, normally by letter sent by normal postal services or, where appropriate, courier services.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li class="terms-header">Fees</li>
                    <ol class="terms-content">
                      <li>You agree to pay us a fee of 10% of the amount recovered if we are successful in winning your claim and the product provider agrees to make and pays that amount. </li>
                      <p>As an example, if the compensation payment received is £2500 then the fee will be £250. Based on an award of £2500 where £500 is received and £2000 is used to reduce a loan then the fee will also be £250. If the whole of the award of £2500 is used to reduce a loan then you would still be liable to pay the £250 fee. </p>
                      <p>If the claim relates to a loan that is then restructured and a cash compensation payment also made then the fee would relate solely to the cash compensation payment.</p>
                      <li> If you have had or have an Individual Voluntary Arrangement or are or been in a Debt Management Plan, then the above fees will still be payable. It would be expected, therefore, that you would make us aware of this and discuss the appropriateness of any claim with us and the administrator of the Individual Voluntary Arrangement or Debt Management Plan.</li>
                      <li>There are no hidden charges.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol class="terms-content">
                      <li>During the period of our engagement we may request information about your personal and financial situation from you.</li>

                    <ol class="terms-content">
                      <li>Your continued instructions in connection with your claim will amount to an acceptance of these Terms of Business. However, it will not be possible for us to start or continue work on your behalf until your signed copy or copies of the Letter of Authority and Disclosure Statement with supporting evidence are received at our office. </li>
                      <li>You may be requested to supply information or complete paperwork. If we do not receive the requested documents within 28 days of the initial request we will assume you are terminating our services.</li>
                      <li>This agreement is subject to a 14 day cooling off period.</li>
                      <li>These Terms of Business may be terminated by either party, with immediate effect, by giving notice in writing or by email. </li>
