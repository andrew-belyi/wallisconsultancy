                  I am a retired senior banker with experience in both mediation and business 
                  support, personable and able to communicate easily at all levels.

                  Having worked within the family court judiciary for over twenty years 
                  I have gained a valuable insight into how the family court system operates. 
                  As such I am particularly highly regarded in family mediation but also in 
                  neighbourhood and workplace mediation. My experience in the family court 
                  has shown me that the court process should be used as a last resort and 
                  that mediation has an important role in helping parties move forward from 
                  conflict and breakdown to agreement and brighter futures.
