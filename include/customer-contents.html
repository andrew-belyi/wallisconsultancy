  <p>Thank you for asking me to act for you in respect of this claim</p><br>
  <p>Following your keying the claim information, you should have been able to generate a Letter of Authority and Disclosure Statement which you will need to print, sign and post to me together with a copy of all documents that are relevant to the claim.  Any problem with this then let me know please and if necessary I will send a further copy to you.</p><br>
  <p>If you have not printed them off already, they are found below.</p><br>
  <p>Letter Of Authority:</p> {download}<br>
  <p>Disclosure Statement:</p> {download2}<br>
  <br>
  <p>
    On receipt of the above I will telephone you to get more background information before submitting the claim. If the claim
    is against a lender then I will ask it to check any other accounts that you may have which have not been specifically
    listed on the Letter of Authority.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    Once the claim has been received by the firm it will then have eight weeks to provide its final response to the claim.
    If the firm does not respond within that timescale or the claim is turned aside then consideration will be given to
    submitting a complaint on your behalf to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    My fee for taking the claim forward is on a No Win No Fee basis and if successful will amount to 10% of the monies received
    by you. Other costs may be payable, however, if the contract is cancelled after the 14 day cooling off period and these are
    set out below.  As an example of my fee, if the compensation payment received is &pound;2500 then the fee will be &pound;250.
    Based on an award of &pound;2500 where &pound;500 is received and &pound;2000 is used to reduce a loan then the fee will also
    be &pound;250. If the whole of the award of &pound;2500 is used to reduce a loan then you would still be liable to pay the
    &pound;250 fee. There are no hidden charges. If the claim is unsuccessful then no fee is due. The full terms and conditions
    can be found in a link at the bottom of this email and also on my website.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    You will of course appreciate that if you feel confident enough to do so you could take the claim forward yourself.
    You also have the right to seek further advice, shop around or cancel the contract within the 14 day cooling off period.
    If you wish to do so then you may use the cancellation form below. Any claims documentation should be read carefully and
    retained.
  </p><br>
  <p>
    My objective is to provide a high level quality of service but if you are not happy with the service that this firm
    offers then you should contact me by email or writing to me at our registered address which is shown on the website.
    If you are not happy with my response then you would then have the right to make a complaint to the Legal Ombudsman.
    Please see my promise to you under Service Delivery on my website.
