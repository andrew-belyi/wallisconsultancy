                          The Financial Services Authority has found that PPI has frequently mis-sold. If it was mis-sold to you then you can make a claim for a payment protection refund to get back the proportion of your monthly loan or credit-card payments that represented the PPI payments, plus interest.

                          No, as we will write to the financial institution under the Data Protection Act asking them for the information that we require to take the payment protections refunds claim forward. If, however, you have the statements then it would speed matters up if you let us have them to calculate the payment protection refund claim. We will need a copy of the Loan Agreement, if available.

                          Each PPI reclaim varies dependent on the financial institution involved. The typical PPI claims take around three months to complete but it can take as little as three weeks. If it is necessary to refer the PPI claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service then it can currently take up to a further 24 months.
