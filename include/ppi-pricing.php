                    <li><strong>No Win, No Fee</strong> - I am so confident that I will win your claim, that I offer a No Win, No Fee service. That means that should your claim be unsuccessful then I won’t charge you for the work done. It really is that simple.</li>
                    <li><strong>No VAT</strong> - As I am a small consultancy there is NO VAT payable on your PPI Claim. This could leave you better off by some £90 on an average claim.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fee 10%</strong> - You agree to pay me a fee of this amount if I am successful in winning your claim and the product provider agrees to make and pays a compensation payment.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Let me get back the money you are owed. Claim Now and I will move very quickly to start your mis-sold PPI claim.</p>
