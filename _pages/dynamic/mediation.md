The service is available for family mediation in Dacorum. This can be face to face or online using Zoom and will be during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Mediation is a voluntary process conducted confidentially in which I assist parties in working towards a negotiated agreement of a dispute or difference.

Family mediation can help you and your ex to work out an agreement about issues such as arrangements for children after you break up, child maintenance payments or a financial settlement.

Mediation can also be useful to help with other issues you might face, such as your children keeping in touch with their grandparents, step families, or in-laws. It can also be useful for disputes within families and friends.

Any agreement reached through mediation, whether verbal or written is not legally binding but it is more likely to succeed as it has not been imposed on the parties.
