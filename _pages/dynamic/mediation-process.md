Once I have confirmation that both parties wish to proceed with mediation I will have separate confidential conversations with each to get the background to the situation, discuss the mediation process and the way forward. 

If all parties wish to have a joint mediation meeting then this will then be set up for a mutually convenient time and date using Zoom.

At the joint Zoom mediation meeting parties will be given uninterrupted time to explain their concerns and affect of the situation on them and others affected by the dispute. Discussion will then take place on finding a mutually agreeable way forward. Any actions would then be set out in a written agreement. 

Fees for this service can be seen in[ Section 5 of Terms and Conditions](https://wallisconsultancy.co.uk/terms).
