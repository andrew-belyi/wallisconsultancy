Once I have confirmation that both parties wish to proceed with mediation I will have separate confidential conversations with parties to get the background to the situation, discuss the mediation process and the next step. 

If all parties wish to have a joint mediation meeting then this will then be set up at a mutually convenient time and date using Zoom.

At the joint mediation meeting parties will be given uninterrupted time to explain their concerns and affect of the situation on them and others affected by the dispute. Discussion will then take place on finding a mutually agreeable way forward. Any actions would then be set out in a written agreement

If you do not wish to be in the same room as the other party at a joint mediation meeting, we may be able to offer you a shuttle mediation service which is where the parties sit in separate rooms and the mediator shuttles between the parties to facilitate the mediation.
